            <h2>Is Coffee Good or Bad for your Health?</h2>
           <p> <li>Although early studies of coffee suggested that it could lead to health problems, recent research provides strong evidence that drinking coffee actually has a variety of health benefits.
               Coffee has both positive and negative effects on health, depending on how much and how often it’s consumed, as well as individual factors like tolerance and medical conditions.</li>

            <h2>What is Coffee?</h2>
            <li>
                Coffee is a blend of sensory experiences and culture. It's that rich, aromatic drink that symbolizes energy, warmth, and comfort. On one hand, it's a ritual; 
                the morning cup that wakes you up or the shared moment in a café with friends. On the other hand, 
                it's a source of focus and creativity, helping to clear the mind for a study session, a task, or even conversation like this.
